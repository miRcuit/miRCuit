# miRCuit : A Regulatory Circuit Analysis Tool 

miRCuit is a circuit analysis program designed to construct regulatory circuits based on Python. The program is developed as a .py (Python) file and can be executed in an environment such as Visual Studio Code.

## Features
- The program can be utilized by transferring the .py file to an appropriate execution environment, such as VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, etc.
- It is accessible to researchers across various fields and operates by loading files containing expression values of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and TF molecules into the system
- As a result, it offers users different types of regulatory circuits related to their research topics.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need the following software and libraries: 
    - Python 3.x
    - pandas (version 2.2.2)
    - PyQt5 (version 5.15.11)
    - gseapy (version 1.1.3)
    - scipy (version 1.14.0)
